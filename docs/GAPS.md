## Two definitions of done

- **(A) MVP per §40** — Echo+goja running on dotnet, /health, /eval, recover, 100
  concurrent, UTF-8, basic goja. Needs everything marked ✅ MVP. Rough order:
  **~6–9 engineer-months**, dominated by emit (XL), net/http+Kestrel (XL),
  goja/typedarrays (L), reflect (L).
- **(B) Polished product** — AOT, release opt, debug/PDB, full test harness,
  benchmarks, CI, broad overlay: **+3–4 months** on top of (A).

Shortest path to first demonstrable value: **M0** (emit `println` end-to-end) →
conformance runner → language features (M1) → big overlays. The `emit` backend is
the bottleneck: nothing else is verifiable until a `.dll` runs under `dotnet`.

## goja end-to-end status (2026-06)

`goja` now **compiles** to a ~15 MB ECMA-335 `.dll`, the assembly **loads and JITs
cleanly** (ilverify-clean `Main`), and package **init runs** through most of x/text.
Reaching this required fixing a long series of codegen-correctness bugs (all with
conformance fixtures): the **4-byte metadata heap-index keystone** (heaps exceed
64 KiB in a program this large), generic instantiations introduced by package-var
initializers being left with empty bodies, the trailing `ret` of a non-void
panic-terminated function, the fat-header `InitLocals` flag, variadic interface
dispatch, **methods promoted from an embedded concrete field** in interface
dispatch, `nil` assigned to a GoSlice/GoMap struct field, and fixed-array struct
fields zeroing to a nil slice. Shim signatures were matched to the Go-derived
externs (atomic Int32 ops, reflect, time, runtime).

Remaining known blockers on the `RunString("1+2")` path (x/text locale init), in
order encountered:

1. **Identical-layout named-struct conversion through a pointer.** `type Tag
   compact.Tag` makes `language.Tag` and `compact.Tag` distinct CLR structs (correct
   for interface dispatch), but Go converts between them as a no-op
   (`(*compact.Tag)(t)`). goclr emits no field reinterpretation, so the method call
   does `unbox.any compact.Tag` on a boxed `language.Tag` → `InvalidCastException`.
   Fix: the struct→struct / *struct→*struct conversion must copy/reinterpret fields
   (or re-box) when source and target share a layout but differ in CLR type.
2. **Struct value-semantics for fixed-array fields on copy.** Returning a struct by
   value should clone its fixed-array field; goclr keeps the backing shared (a slice
   field aliasing the array still observes the original after the copy). Edge case,
   surfaced by the scanner repro (conformance 358 covers the in-function path).

These are the next x/text-init items before the JS evaluator itself is exercised.

## goja runs JavaScript (2026-06)

goja now **evaluates JavaScript** through goclr: `vm.RunString` returns correct
results for arithmetic (`1+2*3` → 7), string concatenation (`"a"+"b"` → "ab"), and
function calls (`(function(x){return x*x})(9)` → 81). See `examples/demo_goja`.
This required, beyond the compile-path fixes above, several runtime-correctness
fixes (each with a conformance fixture): identical-layout named-struct conversion
(`type Tag compact.Tag`), a pointer-receiver method promoted from an embedded value
field mutating through a pointer, `*p = v` boxing a value type into an interface
cell, `a, b = f()` keeping a concrete result boxed for an `interface{}` target, and
multi-result `return s, nil` boxing a value-type nil as `NilSlice`.

### Update — much-expanded working set

Two further runtime fixes (each with a conformance fixture) unblocked a large swath:

- A named value stored into an interface-element slice (`code[pc] = jne(target)`,
  `code []instruction`, `jne` a named int32) kept its typed-box identity, so
  interface dispatch on the element matches (conformance 364). This was the SHARED
  root cause of both loops AND arrays: the compiler backpatches jump instructions
  into the bytecode this way.
- A slice's capacity region (`s[len:cap]`) now holds the element zero value for both
  `make(cap)` and append-grown backings (conformance 365), instead of nulls — goja
  reads a sentinel in the last cap slot.

With these, goja evaluates a **large** JavaScript subset on the CLR: arithmetic,
strings and string methods (`toUpperCase`/`slice`), `Math`, objects and property
access, function calls/closures, and `for`/`while` loops (see `examples/demo_goja`).

### Update — the remaining frontier is closed (array callbacks + JSON)

The three frontier items now evaluate byte-identically to `go run` (each with a
conformance fixture):

1. **Array callbacks** — `[].map`/`filter`/`reduce`/`sort(comparator)` work. Root
   cause: a field-alias `&a.prop` GoPtr carried no type id, so goja's
   `prop.(*valueProperty)` assertion failed (a typed nil). Field aliases now tag the
   pointee struct's type id (`Rt.FieldPtr(getter, setter, typeId)`, conformance 366).
2. **`JSON.stringify`** — objects, nested arrays, round-trips. Root cause: a type
   switch `case String:` matched `*Object` because `isinst object` matches every
   reference; the match now tests interface satisfaction (conformance 367).
3. **`JSON.parse`** — nested objects/arrays. Root cause: `tok.(json.Delim)` (both
   comma-ok and single-value) failed for the typed-box `json.Delim` — the assertion
   used `isinst` on the int32 representation and never matched the `GoNamed` wrapper.
   Type assertion to a named non-struct type now matches the wrapper id
   (conformance 368).

`examples/demo_goja` exercises all of these. The one true remaining representation
gap (orthogonal to goja's evaluator, no longer on the goja path): a typed-nil pointer
stored in an interface compares `== nil` true where Go yields false. Tracked in
LIMITATIONS.md.

`GOCLR_PANIC_TRACE=1` makes the runtime print a panic's throw-site .NET stack — the
key tool for locating these (a `recover()` otherwise masks the origin).

## reflect — runtime type descriptors (2026-06)

`reflect` is now driven by compile-time **type descriptors** rather than runtime
samples — the foundation reflection-heavy libraries (encoding/json, validator, ORMs)
need. `Kind`/`Name`/`String`/`NumField`/`Field`/`Elem`/`Key` are precise (including
sized-integer kinds and struct field types/tags), for both the static path
(`reflect.TypeOf(concreteValue)`) and the dynamic path (`reflect.TypeOf(interface{})`,
recovered from the value's identity). Type construction (`MapOf`/`SliceOf`/`PtrTo`/
`ArrayOf`), the method set (`NumMethod`/`Method`/`Implements`/`AssignableTo`/
`ConvertibleTo`), and `Zero`/`New`/`MakeSlice`/`MakeMap` are descriptor-backed.
Verified byte-identical to `go run` (conformance 375–378). Full design and the one
remaining limit (a *bare* unnamed sized scalar reflected only dynamically) in
[REFLECT.md](REFLECT.md). Tag `0.0.29.reflect-complete`.

## gin end-to-end status (2026-06)

Gin (pinned to **v1.10.1**; v1.12+ pulls an HTTP/3 / BSON tree) is the second
web-framework validation target after the goja work. The compiler builds with the
`purego` and `nomsgpack` tags (no-assembly/no-unsafe code paths; drops the MessagePack
`ugorji/go/codec` dependency), and a handful of project overlays cut the genuinely
unlowerable third-party code at gin's own binding/render seams (go-toml, protobuf,
encoding/xml) and replace unsafe in dependency libraries (validator, sha3, fasttemplate,
bytesconv).

Driving the build surfaced — and closed — a broad swath of **Go-stdlib coverage** (all
shims are stdlib; the compiler stays third-party-agnostic): `net` address parsing and
`net.IP` methods, `net/mail`, `net/textproto`, `io/fs.FileMode`, `sync/atomic.Value`,
`time.ParseDuration`/`ParseInLocation`/`LoadLocation`, `encoding/base64.Encoding`
length/Encode/Decode, `crypto/sha3` (+SHAKE), `crypto/subtle.XORBytes`, `bytes.Runes`/
`IndexRune`/`IndexAny`/`Trim`, `http.Header` (live response headers) + form/header/query
binding, `url.URL.Query`/`RequestURI`, and several general lowering fixes (cross-package
function values, parenthesized inc/dec, `*[N]T` element field-write and address-of, a
shim-type method promoted from an embedded field). gin compiles through the
`go-playground/validator` (which exercises `reflect` heavily), `yaml.v3`, and all of
gin's form/header/query/JSON binding and rendering.

**Status: gin runs end to end.** `examples/demo_gin` (router) and
`examples/demo_gin_sql` (a Gin REST API over `database/sql` + the pure-Go zero-cgo
SQLite engine `go-r2-sqlite`, full CRUD byte-accurate) both serve correct responses
on the CLR. The server runtime bridges gin's `*Engine` across goclr's static-dispatch
boundary via a per-`http.Handler` ServeHTTP adapter (`Http.RegisterHandler`), driven
by an `HttpListener` loop. The HTTP/1 path is fully exercised; HTTP/2 (`x/net/http2`)
is not on the served path.

## Echo end-to-end status (2026-06)

Echo v4 **runs** on the CLR (`examples/demo_echo`): `/health`→`ok`,
`/ping`→`{"message":"pong"}`, `/hello/:name`→`{"hello":"x"}` (path params),
`/missing`→404 with Echo's own JSON body. The whole framework lowers — including its
`crypto/x509` + `acme`/`autocert` TLS closure (the TLS path is an honest no-op shim;
plain HTTP/JSON is fully exercised) — with **no overlays** (real echo/acme Go
compiled). Reaching it needed two compiler fixes (typing an opaque-shim field setter
from the field's Go type so `http.Server.Handler = e` boxes correctly; removing
`net.Listener` from the shim *method* registry so it dispatches as the interface it
is) and a serving bridge that releases echo's own bound port to the `HttpListener`.

## KrakenD / Lura distance (2026-06)

Measured by compiling KrakenD's core framework, **Lura**
(`github.com/luraproject/lura/v2`), through goclr: **no goclr language or compiler gap
is the blocker.** Every wall is a third-party *native* dependency (overlay / build-tag
territory): `go-playground/validator` unsafe (overlay exists), go-toml/v2's
`SubsliceOffset` (now compiles directly — see the `reflect.SliceHeader` offset views),
quic-go HTTP/3 (raw sockets + asm + unsafe — must be cut, as gin pinned to v1.10.1
avoids), `x/net` asm, and Go `plugin` (external plugins, unportable to .NET; the core
CE runtime runs without them). The probe surfaced two real goclr gaps, both fixed:
`regexp.(*Regexp).FindAllStringSubmatch` and Go 1.22+ type aliases (`types.Unalias` in
the type lowering). So the distance to KrakenD is an overlay/build-tag campaign on
Lura's deps plus the plugin limit — not compiler work.

## GORM distance (2026-06)

Measured by compiling `gorm.io/gorm/schema.Parse` (the reflect-heavy core that turns a
tagged struct into a table/column schema) through goclr. **No goclr language/compiler gap
blocks it** — the walls are a chain of small stdlib/dependency method gaps, each a shim:
fixed so far are `time.Time.Date`/`Clock`/`AddDate` (via jinzhu/now) and the
`runtime.Callers`/`CallersFrames`/`(*Frames).Next`/`runtime.Frame` caller-location
machinery (stubbed — goclr has no Go stack metadata, so gorm logs SQL without a
`file:line`, which gorm tolerates). The next wall is gorm's `log/slog` handler wrapper
(`slog.Handler.Enabled`/`Handle`/`WithAttrs`). Beyond schema parsing, full ORM operations
also need a **pure-Go dialector/driver** (the cgo-free `glebarez/sqlite` or a goclr port of
the existing `go-r2-sqlite`). So GORM is a multi-step shim/overlay campaign — not a single
compiler gap — and is left as a staged target; the generally-useful shims it surfaced
(time multi-return methods, the runtime caller stubs) are landed independently.

## Performance & AOT distance (2026-06)

Measured, not yet engineered — the levers and their distance:

- **Startup is already good for typical programs**: a hello-world goclr `.dll` starts in
  ~20 ms. A *large* assembly is JIT-bound: goja (~15 MB) takes ~3.2 s to first output,
  almost entirely first-run JIT of its method set. Tiered compilation (quick-JIT-first) is
  already on by default, so config tuning yields little here.
- **ReadyToRun (crossgen)** is the realistic lever for large-program startup: precompiling
  the app + `GoCLR.Runtime`/`GoCLR.Stdlib` to native via `dotnet publish
  -p:PublishReadyToRun=true` would cut goja's cold JIT. It needs a generated publish project
  (the current output is loose framework-dependent dlls) — a packaging task, not a compiler
  change. This is the highest-value next perf step.
- **NativeAOT is infeasible without rework.** The shim runtime is reflection-heavy by
  design — `Closures.InvokeShim` (`MethodInfo.Invoke`), the `[GoShim]` attribute scan
  (`GoShim.cs`), `reflect`'s `Value_FieldByName`/`TypeReg`, the callback bridge — all of
  which NativeAOT's trimming removes or can't invoke. AOT would require routing the shim
  surface through source-generated, statically-rooted dispatch (no `MethodInfo.Invoke`,
  no attribute scanning). Large; tracked, not started.
- **Throughput** is bounded by the object-boxed value model (every `any`/interface/slice
  element is a boxed `object`). Typed IL / specialized slices (roadmap "Typed IL, no mass
  boxing") is the lever — a substantial backend change, also the prerequisite that makes the
  emitted code more AOT/trim-friendly.

The emitted assembly already links against Release-built runtime/stdlib; the
runtimeconfig carries a `configProperties` block as the place to tune host options.

## Fiber distance (2026-06)

Measured by compiling a minimal `gofiber/fiber/v2` app. Fiber is built on **fasthttp** (its
own HTTP stack, not net/http), so the distance is a fasthttp campaign, not a quick target.
Fiber's own packages compile after closing generally-useful gaps: the `testing` overlay is
now applied to ALL builds (fiber's `utils` imports `testing` in non-test code for a `TB`-based
assert helper), `os.Args` is shimmed (and shimmed value-typed vars now unbox correctly — a
general fix), and `text/tabwriter` compiles from source (fiber's assert helper formats with
it; it is dead code when serving). The wall is fasthttp's dependency tree: `andybalholm/brotli`
(a compression dep) hits a goclr lowering gap — **nested field assignment through a slice
element** (`nodes[pos].u.shortcut = …`, i.e. `s[i].a.b = v`). So supporting Fiber means: (1) the
`s[i].a.b = v` lowering, (2) working through brotli/gzip compression, (3) the fasthttp core
itself. A staged target, like gin's x/net/http2 was.

### Unsafe/asm wall measurement (2026-06) — there is NO unsafe wall

An earlier note guessed "fasthttp is unsafe-heavy (its own buffer/socket code)". **That was wrong.**
Measured directly against `fasthttp@v1.51.0` + its full dependency tree:

- **fasthttp core: 4 active `unsafe` sites**, all in `b2s_*.go`/`s2b_*.go` — bytes↔string
  conversions. On **Go 1.20+** the selected files use `unsafe.String(unsafe.SliceData(b), len(b))`
  / `unsafe.Slice(unsafe.StringData(s), len(s))` — exactly the safe idioms goclr already lowers.
  The hard `(*reflect.SliceHeader)(unsafe.Pointer(&b))` header-write form is behind `//go:build
  !go1.20`, so it is never selected on a modern toolchain. `server.go` has no active unsafe.
- **andybalholm/brotli: 0 unsafe.**
- **klauspost/compress: 0 *active* unsafe** — the 6 `unsafe.Pointer` lines in
  `flate/huffman_bit_writer.go` are all **commented out** dead code next to the
  `binary.LittleEndian.PutUint64` calls that replaced them.
- **Assembly: not a wall.** The only `.s` files are `klauspost/compress/flate/matchlen_amd64.s`
  (pure-Go fallback `matchlen_generic.go` is auto-selected on non-amd64 / with the `noasm` tag) and
  `klauspost/cpuid` (**not imported** by the fasthttp/compress path). No cgo.
- **syscall: trivial** — fasthttp `tcp.go` uses only `syscall.ECONNRESET` in an `errors.Is`
  comparison. **reflect: none** in core.
- `goclr analyze` reports every compression dep **OK** and fasthttp itself only **WARN
  GCLR0202 "unsafe used with approved patterns only"** → result *"compatible with profile
  echo-goja"*.

**Conclusion: fiber/fasthttp has no fundamental (unsafe/asm/cgo) blocker.** The distance is the
ordinary stdlib lowering long-tail — the same tractable shim work that got gin and echo running
end-to-end — starting at `io.MultiWriter` (the first and currently-only hard lowering gap on the
path; see below). This makes fiber a *worthwhile, staged* target rather than a dead end. The first
real lowering blocker after the compress shims (range `*[N]T`, ReadUvarint, crc32, bits.Reverse —
all closed in `0.0.67`) is `io.MultiWriter`.

### Progress (2026-06, tag `0.0.67.fiber-compress-shims`)

Step (1) is **done** (`s[i].a.b = v`, fixture 411) and several compression-layer gaps from
step (2) are closed as generally-useful, data-driven shims — each with a standalone fixture so
they are verified independent of the (still-incomplete) fiber build:

- **`range` over `*[N]T`** (pointer-to-array): deref to the backing slice then range. General
  Go feature, was missing. Fixture 412. (`klauspost/compress/flate` huffman tables.)
- **`math/bits.Reverse8` / `Reverse16`** (flate huffman code building). Fixture 414.
- **`encoding/binary.ReadUvarint` / `ReadVarint`** over any `io.ByteReader` (known shim readers
  read directly; a user reader is driven through the callback bridge). Fixture 413.
- **`hash/crc32.Update` / `NewIEEE` / `IEEETable`** (gzip CRC). `NewIEEE()` reuses the existing
  `GoHash32` digest with a `crc32` algo branch; `IEEETable` is an opaque `*Table` handle that
  `Update` ignores (only the IEEE polynomial is materialised). Fixture 414.

**`io.MultiWriter` — LANDED** (gzip `WriteTo`, fixture 415). `"io"` is now in
`compileFromSource`: `io` is pure Go (imports only `errors`+`sync`), its full source lowers, and
because `shimExtern` precedes `byFunc` in `namedFuncCall` the existing `io.Copy`/`ReadAll`/
`WriteString` shims keep winning — only the un-shimmed funcs (`MultiWriter`/`MultiReader`/
`TeeReader`/`Pipe`) come from source, so their per-writer/-reader `Write`/`Read` go through normal
interface dispatch. The heterogeneous-dispatch problem (digest + user writer in one call) solves
itself this way.

Two real bugs surfaced and were fixed, both **general** (not io-specific):

1. **`shimNamedType` scanned `l.pkg`, not `c.root`.** The opaque-shim-name→`*types.Named` map is
   built once, lazily, from whichever package first triggers it. With `io` lowered from source,
   `io` (narrow closure: `errors`+`sync`) triggered it first and froze a map missing `bytes.Buffer`
   etc. — so `w.Write(p)` over a shim writer matched no implementer and nil-panicked. Fixed by
   scanning from `c.root` (the main package, whose closure spans the whole program). This is the
   same `c.root`-not-`c.pkg` lesson the io.Writer bridge commit learned for `lookupNamedType`;
   `shimNamedType` had the identical latent bug, dormant until a narrow-closure from-source package
   triggered it first.
2. **`shimMethodExtern`'s interface guard over-triggered on from-source stdlib implementers.** The
   guard suppresses the shim short-circuit when an interface receiver has lowered implementers (so a
   user `fs.FileInfo` isn't mis-cast to the one shim handle — the net.Listener/GoFileInfo fix). But
   `io`-from-source adds internal types (`io.nopCloser`) implementing `io.ReadCloser`, which flipped
   `resp.Body.Close()` (resp.Body is always a `GoReader` handle) into interface dispatch, where it
   matched nothing and nil-panicked (regressed conformance 388). Fixed by ignoring implementers from
   `compileFromSource` stdlib packages in that guard — they never flow as a shim-backed interface
   field's receiver; user/app implementers still suppress the short-circuit.

Regression pass (io is high-blast-radius — every program links it): full conformance suite (415
fixtures incl. the httptest loopback-server fixture 388) green, `goja` demo byte-exact, lower/emit/
analysis tests (incl. the shim-signature validators) green. The `gin_sql` startup panic and the
`gin`/`echo` IPv6/HttpListener serving-bridge binding quirk are **pre-existing** (identical with
`io`-from-source disabled) and orthogonal to this change. fasthttp's core (step 3) is next.
